I have commited the first code for checking the Armstrong number
153: 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153
125: 13 + 23 + 53 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)
1634: 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1643
Similarly, we can check other number also.
The first few Armstrong numbers between 0 to 999 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 153, 370, 371, 407
Some other Armstrong numbers are 1634, 8208, 9474, 54748, 92727, 93084, 548834, 1741725, 4210818, 9800817, 9926315
